        <h2>What does the SpookyVibes API do?</h2>
        <p>This REST API is the server-side component of the SpookyVibes web application. The API (still in progress!) will provide users with access to information about different horror movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite scary movies. </p>
